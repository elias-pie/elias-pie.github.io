# Background
So me and [Beckett](https://www.instagram.com//beckettjensen21) were curious about people's thoughts on the new personal computer ban at TVHS. After consulting eachother for a bit, 
we created a (google form)[https://forms.gle/q3rZJENtHu4xR9w3A] asking aboutpeople's thoughts. As of now (1/1/26, this form has 46 responses.
